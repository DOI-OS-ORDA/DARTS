The Elliott Bay Trustee Council (Trustees) is developing the  Lower Duwamish River Natural Resource Damage Assessment (LDR/NRDA) to determine the extent of  injuries to natural resources resulting from these releases. Natural resources include fish, shellfish,  wildlife, sediments, and water quality, and the services they provide. Trustees are also determining how  to restore injured natural resources and lost resource services. The Restoration Plan, which is also a  Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) will guide implementation of LDR/NRDA  restoration activities. The PEIS analyzes the environmental impacts of the alternatives considered by the  Trustees to restore, replace, rehabilitate, and/or acquire the equivalent of the injured natural resources  and their services. The Trustees evaluated three alternatives: the No-Action Alternative, which is required  to be included in the analysis; the Species-Specific Restoration Alternative; and the Integrated Habitat  Restoration Alternative. The Trustees’ preferred alternative is Integrated Habitat Restoration, which is a  comprehensive plan based on restoration of key habitats that, together, will benefit the range of different  resources injured by releases of hazardous substances in the LDR. In addition, the Trustees have included  a detailed description of the methodology considered for use in a settlement-based approach to injury  assessment for the Lower Duwamish River. A draft RP/PEIS was made available for public review on May  22, 2009, with the comment period ending on July 28, 2009. In response to comments received on that  draft, the Trustees added more detail about the injury assessment and restoration valuation methodology  used in the LDR/NRDA, and made some other minor changes to address other comments. The Trustees  released the Supplement to the draft RP/PEIS for additional review and comment on July 27, 2012, with  the comment period ending on October 10, 2012.
